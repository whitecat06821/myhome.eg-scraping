python turbo_owner_scraper_enhanced.py
```

- ✅ **Total**: 20,000+ unique phone numbers
- ✅ **Format**: `+995 571 233 844` (with spaces, General cell type)

## 📁 OUTPUT FILES

- **owners.xlsx** - Owner phone numbers only
- **enhanced_runner.log** - Detailed execution log

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING
If you get low numbers (like 800 owners, 2000 agents):
1. **Use the enhanced scrapers** - they have better discovery methods
2. **Check logs** for any errors
3. **Run individual scrapers** to see which one is working better

## 🆘 NEED HELP?
- Check the logs in the console output
- Look for error messages
- The enhanced scrapers should automatically discover many more URLs

---
**Note**: The enhanced scrapers use multiple discovery methods to find significantly more URLs, which should help reach the 10,000 target for each category.
